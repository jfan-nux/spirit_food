When generating ID cards, blend traits:

1. **Base traits** come from the dish type personality
2. **Cuisine modifier** adds 1-2 cuisine-specific traits

Example blending for "Unhinged Vietnamese Pho":
- **Pho traits**: Healing, complex broth, slurping required
- **Vietnamese modifier**: Herb-forward freshness, grandmother wisdom
- **Unhinged alignment**: Late night energy, no rules, chaos

Result emphasizes: 3am healing power, herbs as lifestyle, broth that judges you affectionately
